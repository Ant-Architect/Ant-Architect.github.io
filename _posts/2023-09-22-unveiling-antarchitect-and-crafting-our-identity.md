Greetings! We're back with exciting updates from the second week of our project. This week, we're thrilled to introduce you to our project's newfound identity and share a sneak peek at our logo concepts.

## AntArchitect: Our Product's Name

After much brainstorming and creative exploration, we are proud to unveil the official name of our AI-powered floor plan generation tool: AntArchitect.

The name is inspired by the remarkable architectural prowess of ants. Just as these tiny insects collaboratively construct intricate structures, our tool will revolutionize floor plan creation with meticulous precision and teamwork. Ants are known for their efficiency and attention to detail, qualities that resonate with our mission.

## Our Logo Concepts

A great product deserves a great visual identity, and we've been hard at work crafting logos that capture the essence of AntArchitect. Here's a glimpse of what we've been creating so far:

## What's Next?

As we enter the third week of our project, we'll be narrowing down our logo choices and preparing for the development phase of AntArchitect. We're excited about the possibilities and can't wait to share more with you as we move forward.

Thank you for joining us on this journey! Together, we'll continue to shape the future of architectural design!

Stay inspired and creative,

*The AntArchitect Team*
