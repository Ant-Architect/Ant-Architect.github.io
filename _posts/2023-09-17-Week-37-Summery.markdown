## Summary

* The group has decided on the name *Ant-Architect*. 
* A logo is to be created by Lana
* Every subgroup creates their own backlog  
* The first meeting next week will focus on combining the backlogs

## Timeline

**The 11 of September**, the group met to go over the report and finalizing the presentation for the following day.

The following day, the group presented their project. In which they detailed the plan for the following 3 weeks. Which mostly consisted of ensuring that everyone was on the same page and had a good understanding.

**The 13 of September**, the group met to discuss an official name, settling on *Ant-Architect*. Additionally, there was talk about what colors should be used for the frontend. Some suggestions were put up and Lana was assigned to create a Logo.

During the meeting it was decided that to properly create a backlog, every subgroup would meet separately to create a backlog specific for them. Then on Monday the 18 of September, the group would have a meeting in which the backlogs are to be combined to reflect the backlog for the whole project.
